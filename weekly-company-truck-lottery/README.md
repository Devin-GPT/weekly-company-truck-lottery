# weekly-company-truck-lottery
This repository contains the source code for a web app designed to streamline company lunch events by suggesting a random food truck each week. The app achieves this by making an API call to fetch food truck data and then selecting one at random to recommend for the event. 

## Summary
The Random Food Truck Selector Web App aims to simplify the process of organizing weekly company lunch events by providing a fun, easy-to-use platform that generates food truck suggestions based on the preferences and constraints of the organization. The app takes the hassle out of deciding on a food vendor, ensuring that employees can enjoy a diverse range of food truck experiences while fostering team building and engagement.

Feel free to contribute to this repository, report any issues, or suggest improvements. Happy coding and bon appétit!

# Development

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
